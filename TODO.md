1. Write problem statements for all algorithms/data structures
2. Write basic tests for all algorithms/data structures
3. Allow user change constant factor on comparison functions to asymptotic benchmarks
4. Allow user to run a separate workbench, which cancels any currently running workbenches
5. Get asymptotic analysis to work again
